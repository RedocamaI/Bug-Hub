# Bug-Hub

## Linux on a desktop or laptop? Terribly buggy.

This is because nobody bothers to qualify the hardware for it, or to upstream drivers for some incredibly common chips. So you end up with reverse-engineered or no drivers.

Bugs are a crucial part of any Linux distro, the reason for that is not only the distribution or the kernel but the system architecture as well. The ongoing development of Linux distros is what even makes a greater chance for facing a bug, but this situation might often arise while using a rolling release distribution, like Open SUSE, Fedora, Arch Linux, since the intensity of bugs is in the maintainer's hand. Normally a distro that contains the most up-to-date packages is the most bug-free which means you could choose from Fedora, Gentoo, and Arch Linux. Then even the three of these distros have maintainers for packages, so in the end, it depends on maintainers' eagerness to keep their packages up to date. However, this topic is kind of 2 sides, that is:

* With respect to a Linux enthusiast, who plans to explore it in-depth, relies on a rolling release distro like Fedora, Arch. Such users also maintain their system and keep track of the latest updates in the community. For them, bug reporting and finding a solution is bliss.
* With respect to a developer who uses Linux packages or features to develop their software, while not going into much depth with their distros. For such users, bugs or issues are frustrating and time-consuming as well.

That's why we have this community that will not only involve an active contribution from category 1 users but also category 2 users. Category 2 users will report the bugs(which will also be done by category 1 users), while category 1 users will find alternative solutions or if possible try to fix those bugs.

## Bug-files
For all the Linux distributions used by our community, you'll find a detailed description of bugs, issues in separate files, for each distro listed below:

* **Unbuntu** OR Debian-based distros [![Ubuntu.MD](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Ubuntu.MD-brown)](#)
* **Fedora** [![Fedora.MD](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Fedora.MD-blue)](#)
* **Arch** [![Arch.MD](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Arch.MD-blue)](#)

Due to such a large community of Linux users, there are multiple types of users. 
There are users whose main goal is to claim for any given bug. 
While there are users who cooperate for the bug to be solved.

## Reporting bugs
There has to be a spceific format in which bugs will be reported so, access the format:

## Which class of user are you in?
We have a place for both types of users. If you want to be any of them, just join our community.
To report a bug, just fork this repo, clone it make changes, create a pull request.
