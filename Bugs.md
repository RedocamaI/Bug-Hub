# Format
## Bug_name
Write a sensible bug name, prefer the one you found on trusted wesites.

## Describe the bug
Describe what the bug is all about. Also, describe how the bug has affected your workflow. Do mention all you know about the bug, even the smallest details matter, like:
  * How you came by it.
  * If you have found the alternate solution to your bug then how much time it consumed. This would help users identify what to expect while dealing with it.

## How to get rid of this bug ?

   [![Use this badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Link2-violet)](#)
   
   And so on ...
