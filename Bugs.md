# Format for reporting a bug, to the community

The described format below has to be **followed** before it's reviewed by the contributors of this project.
Try your best to **stick to the format** and provide a sufficient and sensible data found(related to the reported bug) for the readers to get a **complete overview** of what the bug is all about.

# Format
## Bug_name
Write a sensible bug name, prefer the one you found on

## Describe the bug
Describe what the bug is all about. Also, describe how the bug has affected your workflow. Do mention all you know about the bug, even the smallest details matter, like:
  * How you came by it.
  * If you have found the alternate solution to your bug then how much time it consumed. This would help users identify what to expect while dealing with it.

## How to get rid of this bug ?
Describe all about the alternative solution, you used to get rid of the bug, or provide a link to where you found that solution. Links should **NOT** be provided in paragraphs OR a single line, it should be like this:

   [![Use this badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Link1-darkblue)](#)
   
   [![Use this badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Link2-darkblue)](#)
   
   And so on ...
   
   Just replace **#** with your link(you'll see **#** only in Edit_file view).

**You are also free to report a bug whose alternate solution is not available**, but do mention the links you have gone through in search for those solutions (in the above mentioned format), which must include the

## NOTE (NOT in the FORMAT)
If you have **NOT** found an alternative to your bug or how it can be solved, your PR might take a bit longer to get merged, once we conform if it's there or not.
